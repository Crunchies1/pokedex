# Pokedex

This project showcases a first generation Pokedex, created with React. It sends a HTTP request to https://pokeapi.co/api/ in order to store and display the Pokemon. It also uses Tailwind CSS in order to style components and make implementation of certain features easier.

## Features

Below is a small list of features which I've implemented into the Pokedex to make it more user friendly and technically detailed.

### Filter System

### Dark Mode

### Toggleable Sidebar

Since I intended to make this project in pure HTML/CSS and JS, while also brushing up on general knowledge of those languages, the complexity of the project was quite low. The main improvements I focused on here were using better HTML semantics, as well as swifter creation of components and pages. Eventually, I plan to host the portfolio after I have a larger selection of projects and skills to showcase.

## Installation

Clone the repository and open the index.html file in a live server.
